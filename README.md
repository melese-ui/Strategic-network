# Strategic-network
A Python implementation exploring eccentricity-based strategic networks. Models the trade-off between network efficiency, link costs, and benefits using graph theory. Includes analysis of star, complete, double-node, and empty networks, with code to calculate utilities and optimize structures based on eccentricity.
